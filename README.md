Bikeshare Ride Data Analysis Posted on GitHub

### Description
The Explore US Bikeshare data analysis project was the second project in the Udacity Programming for Data Science Nanodegree.  The project used python to analyze data for three major cities-New York City, Chicago, and Washington.  The resulting output was an interactive experience for the end user that answered the following questions within the data sets:

Most common start station.
Most common end station.
Most common route.
Total travel time in city.
Mean travel time in city.
Number of users by type.
Counts by gender.
Oldest rider (only available for Chicago and New York City).
Youngest rider (only available for Chicago and New York City).
The most common year of birth for riders (only available for Chicago and New York City).

### Files used
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for the following cities:

##End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
##Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
##Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
##End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
##User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

Chicago and New York City also have the following addtional columns:
